# Randomness

Although I am not measuring it,  just by eye balling the samples, I can see that some algorithms generate random patterns while others generate regular repetitive patterns.

Pach1 gets a C because the pattern it generates is quite repetitive and regular.  Not natural at all.

Pach2 gets an A.  I don't see any pattern at all

Pach3 gets a B.  You can clearly see gaps,  however there is no discernible pattern on the gaps themselves,  they look very random.

Pach4 gets an A-.  The pattern is absolutely pefectly random as long as the sampling is done within one tile. But I downgraded it because for infinite maps, the pattern will repeat over and over.
